    <h2>What's this?</h2>
    <p>
        A community of sites around a common topic, also known as a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Webring">webring</a>. 
        Each member includes a badge on their site that links to the previous and next sites in the ring. 
        Kids in the 90s used to love it!
    </p>

    <h2>How to join</h2>
    <p>
        To join the webring, simply fill out the following form. 
        I, Frinkel, will then look at your site, ensure you're not a troll or something, and add you.
        You can also send me a message on the Fediverse at 
        <a href="https://transfurrmation.town/Frinkeldoodle">@Frinkeldoodle@transfurrmation.town</a> 
        with your URL and your desired name.

    <h2>Add the banner</h2>
    <p>
        Once you've joined the ring, copy this code snippet into your site:
    </p>

    {% highlight 'html' %}{% include 'snippet.njk' %}{% endhighlight %}

    <p>
        It will render this banner that links to the other members:
