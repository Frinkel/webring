# Code of Conduct

A few ground rules for being added to the webring (don't worry, they're reasonable!):

- You must actually like furry transformation in order to be a part of this webring. If you don't like transformation... why are you looking at this? Surely there's a billion other websites you'd rather be looking at :P

- Everyone should feel safe and welcomed in this webring, regardless of their age, sex, gender, species, skin color, religion or any other such factors. Therefore, those whom align with hate groups (such as Nazis Trans-Exclusionary Radical Feminists) are not welcome in this webring, as ideologies that fail to tolerate others should not be tolerated themselves.

- As furry transformation gets into the fetishy, kinky part of the Internet, only those whom are 18 years of age or older will be added to the webring.

- I, Frinkeldoodle, reserve the right to deny entry to or remove people from this webring at any time for any justifiable reason.
